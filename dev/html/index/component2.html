	<h1>Encore DPP DIA - Digital Resource Guide (DRG)</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>This online Digital Resource Guide aims to be a centralized place in which all the different elements that are being designed for the DIA project will be implemented, in order for developers to have a quick reference and code samples for their usage.</p>

  <p>In the <a href="design.html">Design Principles</a> section, we explain the principles that act as our pillars for the site's design and structure, and in each section we discuss how these principles tie in with the whole.</p>

	<p>These pages go alongside the Web Design Document, which will contain the same information, but in a printable, shareable format.</p>
